# Start with SQLlite


## Installation

To install SQLlite

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install sqlite3```

Then check installation with:

```sqlite3 --version ```

Install the php interpreter in CLI mode, in case we need to do some programming with a Database and not only SQL requests.

See the ecphp folder.
