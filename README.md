# sqltraining

# 1st step created github repo "sqltraining"

Then,


```
echo "# sqltraining" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/jolegrand10/sqltraining.git
git push -u origin main

```

Good idea, to check
```
git status

On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.README.md.swp
	.bash_history
	.bash_logout
	.bashrc
	.cache/
	.lesshst
	.profile
	.ssh/
	.sudo_as_admin_successful
	.viminfo
	.vscode-server/
	.wget-hsts

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

git remote -v

origin	https://github.com/jolegrand10/sqltraining.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/jolegrand10/sqltraining.git (push)

```
